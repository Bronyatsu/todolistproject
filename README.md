# todoproject

# Goal of the project
Todo project is a very simple to do list application where the user can create a task by typing the task into an input field and pressing enter or the 'Add Task' button.
After a task is created, it can be marked or unmarked as completed via a checkbox.
If the user desires, they can delete a task by clicking on the 'x' next to it.
I used Django and Django's rest framework, because that's what the assignment's specification required.
One of the challenges were to learn REST, as I was unfamiliar with the framework prior to this assignment. Another challenge was revisiting my knowledge of Django, html and using git after some months of break time.
